# Portfolio website Milestone Project

Welcome to my Portfolio website!

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

## UX

The first impression upon visiting the website should be focussed on.

## Project Description

This site was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like gitpod, Git & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code. The project itself will display a breakdown of the different technologies used in each of the different sections of the program

## Technology

This project was written in HTML & CSS using Gitpod and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
Technologies Used
In this project we used some simple HTML5 and CSS3 supported by Bootstrap 4 to build the project, we wrote our code using Gitpod Workspaces and we've backed it up using Git and GitHub.
